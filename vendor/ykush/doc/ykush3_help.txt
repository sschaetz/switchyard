1. Downstream port commands
---------------------------

The structure of the downstream port commands is as follows.

ykushcmd ykush3 [-s <serial_number>] -<action> <port>

Where:

serial_number               Serial number of a board. This is an optional parameter
                            useful for when multiple boards are attached to the 
                            same host.
                            
action                      u -> Turn ON/UP the downstream.
                            d -> Turn OFF/DOWN the downstream.
                            g -> Get downstream port status.
                            l -> List boards attached.
                            
port                        1, 2 or 3.



Some examples:

Turn OFF the downstream port 1 (if only one YKUSH3 board is attached).

> ykushcmd ykush3 -d 1

Turn OFF the downstream port 1 of the board with serial number YKB00001.

> ykushcmd ykush3 -s YKB00001 -d 1

Get status of downstream port 2

> ykushcmd ykush3 -g 2

List attached YKUSH3 boards

> ykushcmd ykush3 -l





2. 5V output switched port control commands
-------------------------------------------

The structure of commands.

ykushcmd ykush3 [-s <serial_number>] -<action>

Where:

serial_number               Serial number of a board. This is an optional parameter
                            useful for when multiple boards are attached to the 
                            same host.
                            
action                      on -> Turn ON.
                            off -> Turn OFF.
                            


Some examples:

Turn OFF the 5V Out port (if only one YKUSH3 board is attached).

> ykushcmd ykush3 -off

Turn ON the 5V Out port of the board with serial number YKB00001.

> ykushcmd ykush3 -s YKB00001 -on




3. IO control commands
----------------------

Structure of commands.

ykushcmd ykush3 [-s <serial_numer>] -<action> <port> [<value>]

Where:

serial_number               Serial number of a board. This is an optional parameter
                            useful for when multiple boards are attached to the 
                            same host.
                            
action                      w -> Write.
                            r -> Turn OFF. When Read action the command will return
                            the read value (1/0). Also in this option, the
                            <value> parameter is not required.
            
port                        1, 2 or 3.
                            
value                       1 -> Set the I/O to digital High Level
                            0 -> Set the I/O to digital Low Level
                            


Some examples:

Set GPIO 2 to high (1).

> ykushcmd ykush3 -w 2 1

Read the GPIO 2.

> ykushcmd ykush3 -r 2


                                        
NOTE: For Windows operating systems add the .exe extension when calling the ykushcmd command.
